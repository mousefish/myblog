Problem: Vercel is a platform to easily deploy and host the nextjs code. if you use Vercel domain, it's very easy to config. if you already have a google, it requires some extra step to configure it. 

### Solution: 
1. In settings tab, Domain, type your google domain  and click add button: 

![settings](/static/images/domain_config/setting.png)

2. Normally just use the default config, and click done.

![domain](/static/images/domain_config/domain.png)

3. Now you will see both the domains shows `Invalid configuration` and then next step is to config the google domain.

4. Go to your google domain account, go to DNS - Custom Record, click Manage Custom Record button, you will see something as below:

![google](/static/images/domain_config/google_setting.jpg)

5. Copy the relative `Ipv4` and `Domain name` content from vercel domain settings to google domain settings. Notice: the default google record should only have one row, you need to add a row and set type to `CNAME`

6. It takes some time for vercel to apply the new settings, and once it finish, it will auto generate a certificate. ðŸŽ‰
