## 1. variables

```rust
const CONST_VALUE: u32 = 10;
let number: f32 = 10;
```

- number is the variable name, f32 is type, 10 is value.
- All variable default is immutable, for safty, concurrency and speed.
- Use let `mut` number: f32 = 10; to change number to a mutable value that can be changed later.
- const defines const type, const type is immutable forever, and it must indicates the type.

## 2. function

```rust
fun do_stuff(a: f32, b: f32) -> f32 {
    {
        let x = 2;
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    // x is not available outside the scope
    a*b
}
```

- a:f32, b:f32 define the function arguments, ->f32 indicate the return type.
- a*b is the return value, same as `return a*b;`, remember if don't use `return`keyward, don't use`;` in the end.
- variable only available in the scope, x is assigned inside {} scope, it will drop automatically when leaving the {}.

## 3. shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 6;
    {
        let x = x * 7; //x is 77
    }
    //x here is 11
}
```

- declare a new variable with the same name as previous is first variable shadowed by the second.
- compile only sees the latest one until it out of scope

## 4. Data Types

### Integer Type:

`u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize, 0xff, 0b1111_0000, b'A'`

- u is unsigned value, i is signed, u/isize is the value depends on 32bit or 64bit system
- type suffix is allowed like `20u8`
- default integer type is i32
- 0xff is hex, 0b is binary, b is byte
- can use \_ to make large number easy read like `1_000_000`

### Float type

`f32, f64`

- default is f64

### Bollean Type

`bool`

### Char Type

`char`

- char type is four bytes in size in rust

### Tuple type

```rust
    let tup: (i32, f32) = (3, 8.8);
    let first_elemnt = tup.0;
    let (first, second) = tup;
```

- tuple element can be different type
- access the tuple value by use .index like tup.0 above
- (first, second) destructures the tup and get the value

### Array Type

```rust
let array: [u32, 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
let first = array[0];
let inital_array = [0; 5] // equal to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

- array must have same type and fixed length
- [u32, 5], first one defines type, second is length
- [0; 5] means inital array value to all 0 and array length is 5
- use array_name[index] to access the array member

## 5. Control Flow

### if..else

```rust
if x<0 {5} else if x<6 {6} else {7}
```

- if condition doesn't need `()` after if like `if(x<0)` in rust
- if can assign value like `let value = if x<0 {5}`, value is 5 here

### loops :

```rust
let count  = 0;
 'first_loop': loop{
    let value = loop {
        if count == 2
        {
            break count;
        }
        count += 1;
        if count == 3
        {
            break 'first_loop'
        }
    }
    count += 1;
 }
```

- `first_loop` is the defined name to distinguish different loops
- `break count` can quit the loop and return the value of count
- `break first_loop` can quit the loop named `first_loop`

### while

```rust
while number !== 0 {
    number -= 1
}
```

### for

```rust
let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
for element in array {
    println!("the value is : {element}")
}
```

## 6. Ownership

```rust
fn main(){
    let s1 = String::from("Owner");
    let s2 = s1;
    //s1 is not available anymore because s1 is move ownership to s2 for the string
    let x1 = 5;
    let x2 = x1;
    //here we can access both x1 and x2, because x1 is on stack, and it int32 applys copy trait to copy the value to x2
}
```

- Rust use ownership to manage memory, there is only one owner for the value in rust, once the value move out of scope, it calls drop to free the memory
- if you want to keep s2 and s1 above both available, use `s2 = s1.clone()` to copy the value, copy trait is not allowed for the value implement the Drop trait

```rust
fn main(){
    let s1 = String::from("Owner");
    get_length(&s1);
}

fn get_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

- we use & to borrow the reference to the string and the ownership now still belong to s1, so when function returns, the s1 is not dropped
- only one mutable browwer can exist during the same scope, but we allowed multiple immutable references.

## 7. Slice

```rust
let s = String::from("Hello World");
let hello = &s[0..5];

let a = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
let a1_2 = &a[1, 3];
assert_eq!(a1_2, &[1,2]);
```

- slice return a reference with pointer and length to the original data
- above `&s[..5]` give the same result, and `s[..]`returs "Hello World"

## 8. Struct

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Shape {
   isRound : bool,
   Box: i32
}

impl Shape{
   fn new() -> Self{
     Self{
         isRound: false,
         Box: 32,
       }
  }

   fn some_function() {} // use Shape::some_function to access, shape instance can not access like shape.some_function
   fn another_function(&self) {} // use self will allowed instance shape to use shape.another_function
}

let s = Shape::new();
```

- #[derive(Debug)] allowed use `println!("{:?}", shape)` or `println!("{:#?}", shape)` to print Shape structure
- also can use `dbg!` in the line to output debug info like `dbg!(&shape)`

## 9. Enum

```rust
enum TestObject {
   Empty,
   Square(u32, u32),
   Round(f32),
   Position {x: f32, y: f32}
}

impl TestObject {
   fn display(&self) {}
}

fn get_result(testobj: TestObject) {
    match testobj {
        TestObject::Square(x,y) => println!("square width {}, height {}", x, y),
        TestObject::Round(x) => println!("round radius {}", x),
        TestObject::Position{x, y}=> println!("position is x: {} y: {}", x, y),
        _ => println!("Empty"),
    }
}

let shape = TestObject::Square(6, 5);
let pos = TestObject::Position{x: 3.0, y: 3.0};

get_result(shape);

if let TestObject::Square(x, y) = shape {
	println!("it match the result square width {} height {}", x, y);
}
else
{
	println!("it doesn't match")
}
```

- Enum can have values in it's element like `Square(u32, u32)`
- Enum can implement function to it
- use `_` to match all other case if don't need the value, otherwise can use `other =>` instead
- use `if let` to compare if the same pattern of the enum and get the value of enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  None,
}
let mut x: Option<i32> = None;
x = Some(5);
x.is_some(); //true
x.is_none(); //false
for i in x {
 println!("{}", i); //print 5
}

enum Result<T, E> {
	Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

- Rust doesn't allowed null value, so if a value need to be null, can set to a Option type, Option can be None, value can be Some(value)

## 10. Module and Path

```
--market
    |___fruit
    |     |____apple
    |___meat
          |____pork
          |____chicken
          |____beef
                |___lean
```

For above structure, market consider as project we created。 so market is the root, we can use crate to represent root. fruit, meat, apple, pork...etc are just different modules under the project.

- if we are in market, to access apple, we can use absolute path which is `crate::fruit::apple`, or relative path `fruit::apple`
- if we are in chicken, to access pork, we can use absolute path like `crate::meat::pork` or relative path `super::pork`, super means parent of current path
- there is no difference between absolute path or relative path, it depends on the project needs. Most time it suggest to use absolute path
- use `use` key word to import the module you need once like `use meat::beef` , then you can use `beef::lean` to access in the same content without call `meat::beef::lean` everywhere
- you can group import module by use `use meat::{pork, chicken, beef}`
- `use meat::*` allows you import everything under meat

```
two ways to build this structure in file system:
src/main.rs
src/fruit.rs
src/meat.rs
src/fruit/apple.rs
src/meat/pork.rs

or

src/main.rs
src/fruit/mod.rs
src/meat/mod.rs
src/fruit/apple/mod.rs
src/meat/pork/mod.rs
```

## 11.Collections

### Vector

```rust
//create new vector
let mut v1:Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
//another way to create new vector by using macro
let v2 = vec![1,2,3];
//insert vector
v.push(2);
//get value form vector by using index
let value& i32 = &v1[0];
//get value from vector by using get function
let value: Option<&i32> = v1.get(2)
//iterate vector
for i in &v1 { println!{"{i}"};}
//use Enum to store different type in vector
enum Shape{
    Round(f32),
    Box(u32,u32),
}
let shape = vec![Shape::Round(3.14), Shape::Box(3,4)];
```

- use get or index to retrive data from vector depends if the program need to panic when index out of bounds, like `v1[1]` will panic because no value in index 1, but `v1.get(1)` will return Option None that you can do something for it.

### String

```rust
//create empty string
let mut s = String::new();
//create string from value by using from
let s1 = String::from("string 1");
//create string from value by using to_string
let s2 = "string 2".to_string();
//append value to string
s.push_str("append s");
//append char to string
s.push('s');
//add strings by using +
let s3 = s1 + &s2; //output: string 1 string 2
//add strings by using format!
format!("{s2}-{s3}"); //output: string 2 - string 1 string 2
//slice string
let ss = &s2[0..6];
//iterating string by char
for c in s3.chars()
//iterating string by byte
for b in s3.bytes()
```

- when use add, s1 is move to s3, s1 will not validate after moving, but s2 is borrowed, so you still can use s2.
- format borrows both s2 and s3, so both value is valid after
- string is not allowed to use index to access, because some word may take more then one byte to store, like "你好" will use 4 bytes, index 0 will not return the first full character. By using slice you will take your own risk to get the correct character

### HashMap

```rust
//create hashmap
let mut count = HashMap::new();
//add hashmap
let cat = String::from("cat");
count.insert(cat, 3);
//read value
count.get("cat").copied().unwrap_or(0);
//iterate hashmap
for (key, value) in &count
//only update value when key is not exist, and it will return a pointer to value 5
count.entry(String::from("cat")).or_insert(5);
```

- cat is not valid after insert into HashMap because cat ownership is move to the count HashMap
- HashMap use `SipHash` hash function, it is not the fastest but provide more security.

## 12. Generic Types

```rust
//function generic type parameters
add(a: T, b: T)->T{
    a+b
}
let result = add(3, 4);
let result = add(0.3, 0.4);

//generic type in struct definitions
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

//generic type in method
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }

//generic type in enum
enum Option(T) {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
}
```

- generic type doesn't affect performance, because during the compile time each generic type will be replace with specific definitions for each instance.

## 13. Trait

```rust
//create a trait
trait DisplayShape {
  fn display (&self)；
  fn defaultDisplay (&self) {
   println!("defined here don't need to be implment again")
 }
}

//implement trait
impl DisplayShape for Shape {
  // here must implement all the function that not defined in the DisplayShape trait
  fn display (&self) {
  println!{ {"{}"}, self.Box}
 }
}

//impl makes the compiler determine type during the compile period
//it will create different version of the function based on how many trait been implemented.
fn display_shape(val: imp DisplayShape) {
   val.display();
}

// dynamic decission of which function to call at runtime, so compile file is smaller
fn display_shape(val: &dyn DisplayShape) {
   val.display();
}

//using where case for trait pass to function to make it clear reading
fn display_shape<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U)->i32
where T: Display + Clone,
      U: Clone + Debug,
```

- not field allowed in trait defining
- function in trait can have default implementation
- `+` in above T, U means tha item must implement both trait

## 14. Lifetime

```rust
//reference with lifetime
&'a i32
//mutable reference with lifetime
&'a mut i32

//life time in function
fn display_shape<'a>(val: &'a str, val: &'a str) -> &'a str

//life time will use smaller life time of the two arguments
//following will show error during compile
let string1 = String::from("this is a outer box");
let result;
{
let string2 = String::from("this is a inner box");
result = display_shape(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
}
println!("result is {}", result);

//life time in struct
struct Shape<'a> {
    name: &'a str
}

//life time in method definitions
impl<'a> Shape<'a> {
    fn box(&self) -> (f32,f32）{
        (3.1,3.1)
    }
}

//life time with generic type, trait
fn shape_area<'a, T>(s: &'a shape, show: T) -> f32
where T: Display
```

- Life time is to make sure the borrowing reference will always valid.
- Rust has 3 rules allows don't always need put lifetime for the parameters to make it simple. Check the rust book.

## 15. Error Handling

```rust
//unrecoverable error
panic!("crash unrecoverable");

//recoverable error
enum Result<T, E>{
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}

//for recoverable error, unwrap will give a panic if error and return result if not panic
File::open("file.txt").unwrap();

//expect will set the panic message
File::open("file.txt").expect("error: file can not open");

//? mark to return the error, if success will continue
File::open("file.txt")?; // equal to return Err(e); when file not open
```

## 16. Closure

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {x + y}
//above function is equal to
let add = |x,y| x+y;
//closure can only accept one type
//below will give error
let i = add(3, 4);
let f = add(3.0, 4.0)

//normally in closure, it will borrow the reference
//if want to use move keyword
move || println!("move list here {:?}", list);
```

## 17. Iterator

```rust
let v = vec![1,2,3];
let v_iter = v.iter();
//loop the iterator
for val in v_iter { println!("got {}", val);}

//next
let mut v1_iter = v.iter();
v1_iter.next() // result is Some(&1)

//sum
let v2_iter = v.iter();
let total = v2_iter.sum(); //result is 1+2+3 = 6, after sum v2_iter is not valid anymore.

//map
let v1:Vec<_> = v.iter().map(|x|x+1).collect(); // result is vec![2,3,4]

//filter
let v2:Vec<_> = v.iter().filter(|x| x>1).collect(); //result is vec![2,3]
```
