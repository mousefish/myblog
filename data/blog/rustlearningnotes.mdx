## 1. variables
```rust
let number: f32 = 10;
```

- number is the variable name, f32 is type, 10 is value.
- All variable default is immutable, for safty, concurrency and speed.
- Use let `mut` number: f32 = 10; to change number to a mutable value that can be changed later. 

## 2. function
```rust
fun do_stuff(a: f32, b: f32) -> f32 {
    {
        let x = 2;
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    // x is not available outside the scope
    a*b
}
```

- a:f32, b:f32 define the function arguments, ->f32 indicate the return type.
- a*b is the return value, same as `return a*b;`, remember if don't use `return` keyward, don't use `;` in the end. 
- variable only available in the scope, x is assigned inside {} scope, it will drop automatically when leaving the {}.
